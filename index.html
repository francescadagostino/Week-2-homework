    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p> Cincinnati is a city located in southwest Ohio right along the Ohio River that separates Ohio and Kentucky. It originally was named Losantiville and nicknamed Porkopolis because of the mass amount of pork that was produced there. It eventually became Cincinnati after the Roman soldier Cincinnatus. The city is laid between the seven hills that make up the local geography.</p>
